## Introduction

Welcome to the Terraform mission for the Martian colony as part of the Phoenix project by the European Space Agency (ESA). Your team is responsible for setting up and securing the infrastructure on Mars using Terraform. You will manage servers, databases, and critical systems while ensuring resilience against simulated cyber threats and guaranteeing secure communication with the Earth-based infrastructure managed by the Azure CLI team.

The final goal of your mission is to successfully establish a secure connection between the Martian and Earth (Azure) infrastructures, enabling data exchange between the two, such as through a ping or message reception.

## Missions

### Step 1 – Deployment of the Martian Infrastructure

1. **Creation of Control Servers:**
   - Use Terraform to provision servers that will play a critical role in managing the colony on Mars.
   - Ensure these servers have **redundancy** (High Availability - HA) to prevent any operational outages.
   - Limit the servers' exposure to the outside world via **private IP addresses**.

2. **Deployment of Databases:**
   - Create and manage resilient databases with automatic replication to avoid loss of critical data.
   - Implement a **backup plan** and a **disaster recovery** procedure in case of system failure.

### Step 2 – Securing the Infrastructure

1. **Security Groups and Firewalls:**
   - Configure **security groups** with Terraform to define traffic rules (inbound and outbound). Allow only essential traffic, such as connections from the Earth-based Azure infrastructure.
   - Implement a firewall to protect access to the Martian infrastructure.

2. **Data Encryption:**
   - Use **SSL/TLS certificates** to encrypt communications between your Martian systems and Earth.
   - Ensure that the disks and volumes associated with the servers and databases are also **encrypted**.

3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
   - Implement restricted access policies using **IAM roles** to grant access only to authorized users or systems.
   - Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for sensitive access.

### Step 3 – Resilience to Simulated Cyberattacks

1. **Automated Security Audits:**
   - Use Terraform to schedule regular security audits, identifying potential vulnerabilities and automatically fixing risky configurations.

2. **Intrusion Response:**
   - Deploy an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
   - Configure automated actions (via Terraform scripts) to disable or isolate compromised systems.

### Step 4 – Interconnection with Azure (Earth) Infrastructure

1. **Opening Communications with Earth:**
   - Set up a secure endpoint on Mars to accept connections from the Earth-based Azure infrastructure.
   - Authenticate requests using public/private keys to ensure that only authorized Earth systems can communicate with Mars.

2. **Setting Up an Inter-Infrastructure VPN:**
   - Create a **secure VPN** between Mars and Earth using IPSec tunnels to ensure encrypted and secure communications.
   - Perform a **ping test** or send a file between the infrastructures to validate the connection.

3. **Monitoring Communications:** we will see
   - Deploy tools to monitor data flow and ensure that all transmissions between Mars and Earth are secure and interference-free.
   - Set up alerts to detect anomalies in traffic.

## Objectives to Achieve

- Deploy a **resilient** and **secure** infrastructure on Mars.
- Ensure protection against simulated cyberattacks (DDoS, intrusions, etc.).
- Maintain **service continuity** with redundant systems.
- Establish a **secure communication** link between Mars and Earth.
- Perform a final test with a **ping** or data exchange between the two infrastructures.

Good luck with your mission! Stay vigilant against cyber threats and collaborate closely with the Azure team to successfully interconnect the infrastructures. May the communication between Mars and Earth be smooth and secure!
