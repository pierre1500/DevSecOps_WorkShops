### **🌍 Welcome, Terraform Commander!**

As part of the **Phoenix Project** initiated by the European Space Agency (ESA), you are entrusted with the monumental task of establishing and securing the infrastructure for the Martian colony. Your expertise in **Terraform** will be pivotal in managing the servers, databases, and critical systems that will sustain life on Mars.

Your mission is not just about deployment; it’s about creating a resilient and secure environment that can withstand simulated cyber threats while ensuring seamless communication with Earth’s infrastructure, managed by the **Azure CLI team**.

### **📝 Mission Brief**

The fate of the Martian colony lies in your hands. Every choice you make will shape the success of this interplanetary venture. Prepare yourself for a series of critical missions that test your skills in Terraform, infrastructure management, and cybersecurity. Each mission is detailed in the links below, where you will build, secure, and maintain the Martian environment.

### **[Mission 3: Building Resilience Against Cyber Threats](Missions/mission_3.md)**
> **Objective**: Implement automated security measures, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), to safeguard the Martian infrastructure. Automate response mechanisms to neutralize threats swiftly.
>
> **Threats**: Advanced persistent threats (APT) and sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at compromising Martian systems.

---

### **[Mission 4: Establishing Interconnection with Earth](Missions/mission_4.md)**
> **Objective**: Establish a high-bandwidth, secure communication link with Earth’s Azure infrastructure. Ensure all transmissions are authenticated and encrypted to prevent data interception.
>
> **Threats**: Signal interference, unauthorized access attempts, and communication breaches.

---

### **[Mission 5: Final Testing and Optimization](Missions/mission_5.md)**
> **Objective**: Conduct thorough system tests to verify the integrity and performance of the Martian infrastructure. Ensure all systems can withstand pressure and remain secure.
>
> **Threats**: System overloads, unexpected failures, and communication breakdowns.

---

## 🎯 **Final Mission Objectives**

- Deploy a **resilient** and **secure** infrastructure on Mars using Terraform.
- Safeguard the infrastructure against simulated **cyber threats** and ensure continuous operations.
- Establish a **secure communication link** with Earth-based systems managed by the Azure team.
- Conduct a **ping test** or data exchange to verify inter-system connectivity.
- Ensure all Martian systems are operational, secure, and ready for the long-term sustainability of the colony.
