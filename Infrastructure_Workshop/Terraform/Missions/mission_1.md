# üõ∞Ô∏è **Mission 1: Earth Infrastructure Deployment** - _Step 1: Establish the Foundation_

**Mission Date**: 2055, _Earth Command Center_

---

### **Mission Overview**

In this mission, you will complete a series of critical steps to establish Earth‚Äôs core infrastructure for secure and efficient communication with the Martian outpost. This infrastructure will serve as the backbone of Earth-Mars operations, ensuring resilient and secure systems that support humanity‚Äôs interplanetary mission.

---

## **Step 1: Deploy the Resource Group ‚Äì Foundation of Earth‚Äôs Operations**

**Objective:** The first step is to create a **Resource Group** to house all essential Earth-based infrastructure. This Resource Group is fundamental for organizing and managing the resources that will support ongoing Mars-Earth collaboration.

**Details:**

- **Resource Group Name:** EarthCommand_RG
- **Location:** francecentral (optimized for real-time Mars-Earth communication)
- **Tags:** asset_owner, asset_project_desc, asset_project_end

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the Resource Group is secure and appropriately tagged to facilitate tracking and management. Every resource within this group will play a role in safeguarding communication links and operational systems.

  <summary>üöÄ Step 1 Deployment Solution</summary>

1. **Authenticate to Azure CLI:**
   Begin by establishing a secure session with Azure:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

2. **Retrieve the Subcription id** Use the Azure CLI to deploy your Resource Group:
   ```bash
   az account set --subscription "The SUBCRIPTION ID FROM CGI"
   ```

</details>

## Step 2: Configure the Virtual Network (VNet) ‚Äì Secure Communications Between Mars and Earth

**Objective**: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) to ensure secure and isolated communications between Mars's resources and operations on Mars.

**Details**:

- **VNet Name**: Mars_VNet
- **Location**: Central US (to minimize latency)
- **CIDR Address**: 10.0.0.0/16 (allowing for multiple subnets)

<details>

  1. **Ensure the provider** 
  ```hcl
  provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
    subscription_id = "xxxxxxx"
  }
  ```

2. **Create the resource group**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "Mars_command_rg" {
  name     = "MarsCommand_RG"
  location = "Central US"
  tags = {
    Mission = "Phoenix"
    Priority = "Alpha"
  }
}
```

</details>

## Step 3: Configure the Virtual Network (VNet) ‚Äì Secure Communications Between Earth and Mars

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.Earth_command_rg.name
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```

## Step 4: Implement Security Rules ‚Äì Protecting Traffic with Network Security Groups (NSGs)

**Objective**: Establish Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic for your resources, enhancing the security of Earth-Mars communications.

**Details**:

- **NSG Name**: EarthMars_NSG
- **Associated VNet**: EarthMars_VNet
- **Inbound Security Rules**:
  - Allow SSH access from Earth Command Center (IP range: 203.0.113.0/24)
  - Allow RDP access from authorized personnel (IP range: 203.0.113.0/24)
- **Outbound Security Rules**:
  - Allow all outbound traffic to enable communication with Martian resources.
  - Deny all other outbound traffic by default.

  location            = azurerm_resource_group.earth_command_rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.earth_command_rg.name
}
```

2. **Inbound Rule - Allow SSH**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "allow_ssh" {
  name                        = "Allow-SSH"
  priority                    = 100
  direction                   = "Inbound"
  access                      = "Allow"
  protocol                    = "Tcp"
  source_port_range           = "*"
  destination_port_range      = "22"
  source_address_prefix       = "203.0.113.0/24"
  destination_address_prefix  = "*"
  network_security_group_name = azurerm_network_security_group.earth_mars_nsg.name
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.earth_command_rg.name
}
```

3. **Inbound Rule - Allow RDP**

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_rule" "allow_rdp" {
  name                        = "Allow-RDP"
  priority                    = 110
  direction                   = "Inbound"
