# üõ∞Ô∏è **Mission 2: Mars Data Systems Deployment** - _Step 1: Establish the Core Database Infrastructure_

**Mission Date**: 2055, _Mars Command Center_

---

### **Mission Overview**

Building on your foundational infrastructure from Mission 2, Mission 3 focuses on deploying a managed database system to support Mars's operations and communications with Earth. This database will be a critical component, storing and managing essential data to facilitate seamless and secure interplanetary communications and operations.

## **Step 1: Deploy the Managed Database ‚Äì Core of Mars Data Operations**

**Objective:** Your first task is to deploy a managed **Azure SQL Database** to handle and secure Mars-Earth data exchanges.

**Details:**

- **Resource Group:** 
- **SQL Server Name:** 
- **Location:** 
- **Database Name:** 
- **Pricing Tier:** 
- **Firewall Rules:** 

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the SQL Server and database are secure, and configure access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

  <summary>üöÄ Step 1 - Define Azure SQL Server</summary>

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_sql_server" "mars_sql_server" {
  name                         = "marsqlserver2055"
  resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.mars_command_rg.name
  location                     = azurerm_resource_group.mars_command_rg.location
  version                      = "12.0"
  administrator_login          = "azureuser"
  administrator_login_password = "<YourComplexPassword>"
  }

  resource "azurerm_sql_database" "mars_comm_db" {
  name                = "MarsCommDB"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.mars_command_rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.mars_command_rg.location
  server_name         = azurerm_sql_server.mars_sql_server.name
  sku {
      name     = "S2"
      tier     = "Standard"
      capacity = 50
  }
  }

  resource "azurerm_sql_firewall_rule" "mars_command_center_access" {
  name                = "MarsCommandCenterAccess"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.mars_command_rg.name
  server_name         = azurerm_sql_server.mars_sql_server.name
  start_ip_address    = "203.0.113.0"
  end_ip_address      = "203.0.113.255"
  }
  ```

</details>

### **üîí Security Checkpoint**

Before proceeding to the next step:

- Verify that the SQL Database is accessible only to authorized IP ranges.
- Review firewall settings to ensure no unauthorized access is permitted.

---

### **Step 2: Configure Database Security Settings**

**Objective:** Strengthen database security by enabling data encryption and setting up advanced threat protection features.

**Details:**

- **Encryption:** Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for the database.
- **Threat Detection:** Enable Advanced Threat Protection to alert on suspicious activities.

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure encryption is active and configure alerts for any unusual activity to safeguard the database.

  <summary>üöÄ Security Configuration Solution for Step 2</summary>

1. **Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** Ensure data is encrypted at rest:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_mssql_database" "mars_comm_db" {
    name           = "MarsCommDB"
    server_id      = azurerm_mssql_server.earth_sql_server.id
    transparent_data_encryption {
      status = "Enabled"
    }
  }
  ```

2. **Enable Advanced Threat Protection:** Configure alerts for potential security threats:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_mssql_server_security_alert_policy" "mars_comm_security_alert" {
    server_id                    = azurerm_mssql_server.earth_sql_server.id
    state                        = "Enabled"
    email_account_admins         = trueaq
    storage_endpoint             = azurerm_storage_account.earth_storage.primary_blob_endpoint
    storage_account_access_key   = azurerm_storage_account.earth_storage.primary_access_key
  }
  ```

</details>

---

### **üîí Security Checkpoint**

Before proceeding:

- Verify that **TDE** is active.
- Ensure Advanced Threat Protection is configured to alert the admin in case of threats.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Database Monitoring and Performance Metrics**

**Objective:** Integrate monitoring tools to track database performance and capture any anomalies.

**Details:**

- **Monitoring Service:** Enable Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for database activity.
- **Alerts:** Configure alerts for high CPU usage and unusual query response times.

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure monitoring is enabled to capture data performance metrics and to promptly notify of any performance issues.

Attempt to enable monitoring and alerting for the database using Terraform based on the details above. If you need guidance, reveal the solution by expanding the section below.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Monitoring and Alerts Solution for Step 3</summary>

1. **Set Up Log Analytics Workspace:** Create a workspace to collect monitoring data:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "earth_data_workspace" {
    name                = "EarthData_Workspace"
    location            = "Central US"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.Earth_command_rg.name
    sku                 = "PerGB2018"
  }
  ```

2. **Enable Monitoring for the SQL Database:** Link the database to Azure Monitor:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting" "earth_data_monitor" {
    name                       = "EarthDataMonitor"
    target_resource_id         = azurerm_mssql_database.mars_comm_db.id
    log_analytics_workspace_id = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.earth_data_workspace.id

    metric {
      category = "AllMetrics"
      enabled  = true
    }

    log {
      category = "SQLInsights"
      enabled  = true
    }
  }
  ```

3. **Set Up Alert for High CPU Usage:** Configure an alert for CPU usage exceeding 80%:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_monitor_metric_alert" "high_cpu_alert" {
    name                = "HighCPUAlert"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.Earth_command_rg.name
    scopes              = [azurerm_mssql_database.mars_comm_db.id]
    description         = "Alert for CPU usage exceeding 80%"
    criteria {
      aggregation        = "Average"
      metric_name        = "cpu_percent"
      operator           = "GreaterThan"
      threshold          = 80
    }
    frequency           = "PT1M"
    window_size         = "PT5M"
  }
  ```

</details>

### **üîí Security Checkpoint**

Before concluding the mission:

- Confirm that monitoring and alerts are configured correctly.
- Ensure that alerts are set up to notify the admin in case of anomalies.

---

### **Step 4: Test Database Connectivity and Performance**

**Objective:** The final step is to verify that the database is operational, secure, and performing as expected under simulated load conditions.

**Details:**

- **Connectivity Test:** Confirm the database can be accessed securely from authorized sources.
- **Load Testing:** Run a performance test to simulate Mars-Earth communication load.

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the database can handle expected traffic volumes and that performance remains optimal under load.

1. **Connectivity Test:** Verify the database can be accessed from Earth Command Center. You can configure a Terraform resource to test connectivity using Azure SQL's built-in capabilities and output results:

  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_mssql_firewall_rule" "earth_command_center_access" {
    name                = "EarthCommandCenterAccess"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.Earth_command_rg.name
    server_name         = azurerm_mssql_server.earth_sql_server.name
    start_ip_address    = "203.0.113.0"
    end_ip_address      = "203.0.113.0"
  }

  output "database_connection_test" {
    value = "Database connection test: Access granted for Earth Command Center IP range."
  }
  ```

2. **Simulate Load Test:** While Terraform does not natively support load testing, you can set up load testing services or scripts as part of the infrastructure. Here‚Äôs a
