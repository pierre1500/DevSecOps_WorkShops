# üõ∞Ô∏è **Mission 1: Earth Infrastructure Deployment** - *Step 1: Establish the Foundation*

**Mission Date**: 2055, *Earth Command Center*

---

### **Mission Overview**

In this mission, you will complete a series of critical steps to establish Earth‚Äôs core infrastructure for secure and efficient communication with the Martian outpost. This infrastructure will serve as the backbone of Earth-Mars operations, ensuring resilient and secure systems that support humanity‚Äôs interplanetary mission.

---

### **Step 1: Deploy the Resource Group ‚Äì Foundation of Earth‚Äôs Operations**

**Objective:** As the first step, your mission is to create a **Resource Group** to house all essential Earth-based infrastructure. This Resource Group is fundamental for organizing and managing the resources that will support ongoing Mars-Earth collaboration.

**Details:**
- **Resource Group Name:** EarthCommand_RG
- **Location:** Central US (optimized for real-time Mars-Earth communication)
- **Tags:** MissionPhoenix, EarthOps, Priority-Alpha

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the Resource Group is secure and appropriately tagged to facilitate tracking and management. Every resource within this group will play a role in safeguarding communication links and operational systems.

### **Step 2: Configure the Virtual Network (VNet) ‚Äì Secure Communications Between Earth and Mars**

**Objective:** Create a **Virtual Network (VNet)** to ensure secure and isolated communications between Earth's resources and operations on Mars. This step is essential to guarantee that all interplanetary communications remain protected from potential threats.

**Details:**
- **VNet Name:** EarthMars_VNet
- **Location:** Central US (to minimize latency)
- **CIDR Address:** 10.0.0.0/16 (allowing for multiple subnets)

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the VNet is configured to allow only necessary connections between Earth's resources and those on Mars.

  1. **Create the Virtual Network:** Use Azure CLI to create the VNet:
     ```bash
     az network vnet create --name EarthMars_VNet --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --location centralus --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16
     ```

  2. **Verify the VNet Configuration:** Ensure that the VNet was created successfully:
     ```bash
     az network vnet show --name EarthMars_VNet --resource-group EarthCommand_RG
     ```

</details>

---

### **üîí Security Checkpoint**

Before proceeding to the next step:
- Ensure that the VNet is isolated from unsecured external networks.
- Configure security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.

---

### **Step 3: Implement Security Rules ‚Äì Protecting Traffic with Network Security Groups (NSGs)**

**Objective:** Establish Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic for your resources. This step is critical to ensure that only legitimate traffic can access your Virtual Network and its associated resources, enhancing the security of Earth-Mars communications.

**Details:**
- **NSG Name:** EarthMars_NSG
- **Associated VNet:** EarthMars_VNet
- **Inbound Security Rules:**
  - Allow SSH access from the Earth Command Center (e.g., IP address range: `203.0.113.0/24`).
  - Allow RDP access from authorized personnel (e.g., IP address range: `203.0.113.0/24`).
- **Outbound Security Rules:**
  - Allow all outbound traffic to enable communications with Martian resources.
  - Deny all other outbound traffic by default.

> **Mission Directive:** Ensure that the NSG is applied to the EarthMars_VNet to enforce these rules effectively.

### **üõ†Ô∏è NSG Configuration Task Brief**

Attempt to configure the NSG yourself using Azure CLI commands based on the details above. If you need guidance, reveal the solution by expanding the section below.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ NSG Configuration Solution for Step 3</summary>

  1. **Create the Network Security Group:** Use Azure CLI to create the NSG:
     ```bash
     az network nsg create --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --name EarthMars_NSG --location centralus
     ```

  2. **Define Inbound Security Rules:** Configure rules to allow SSH and RDP access:
     ```bash
     az network nsg rule create --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --nsg-name EarthMars_NSG --name Allow-SSH --protocol tcp --priority 100 --destination-port-range 22 --source-address-prefix 203.0.113.0/24 --access Allow --direction Inbound
     ```

     az network nsg rule create --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --nsg-name EarthMars_NSG --name Allow-RDP --protocol tcp --priority 110 --destination-port-range 3389 --source-address-prefix 203.0.113.0/24 --access Allow --direction Inbound
     ```

  3. **Define Outbound Security Rules:** Allow all outbound traffic while denying all others:
     ```bash
     az network nsg rule create --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --nsg-name EarthMars_NSG --name Allow-All-Outbound --protocol '*' --priority 100 --access Allow --direction Outbound
     ```

     ```bash
     az network nsg rule create --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --nsg-name EarthMars_NSG --name Deny-All-Outbound --protocol '*' --priority 200 --access Deny --direction Outbound
     ```

  4. **Associate the NSG with the VNet:** Apply the NSG to the EarthMars_VNet:
     ```bash
     az network vnet update --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --name EarthMars_VNet --network-security-group EarthMars_NSG
     ```

  5. **Verify NSG Configuration:** Check that the NSG has been correctly applied:
     ```bash
     az network nsg show --resource-group EarthCommand_RG --name EarthMars_NSG
     ```
