# üõ† **Mission 4: Automate Security Responses** - *Step 4: Implement Automatic Security Responses to Protect Critical Resources*

**Mission Date:** Current Day, *Earth Datacenter*

---

### **Mission Overview**

In dynamic environments, security threats must be mitigated swiftly to avoid system vulnerabilities. In this mission, you will design automated security responses that activate in response to specific triggers, such as unauthorized access attempts, abnormal activity, or errors within critical resources. This will reduce manual intervention, enhancing both security and efficiency.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Automated Responses with Azure Logic Apps**

**Objective:** Use **Azure Logic Apps** to create workflows that automate security responses. For instance, if an unauthorized access attempt occurs in Key Vault, Logic Apps could automatically trigger an alert and temporarily restrict access.

**Details:**
- **Trigger Examples:** Unauthorized access, CPU spikes on VMs, recurrent SQL errors
- **Automated Responses:** Alerting, restricting access, logging events

> **Mission Directive:** Create an automated security workflow using Logic Apps that responds to potential security threats.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Task: Configure Logic Apps for Automated Security Actions**

Develop Logic Apps workflows for automated threat response. Solution available below if needed.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Solution for Step 1</summary>

  1. **Create a Logic App** in Azure.
  2. **Set a trigger** for "Unauthorized access attempt in Key Vault."
  3. **Design actions**: Upon triggering, automatically restrict access and log the event.

</details>

---

### **üîí Security Checkpoint**

Ensure that:
- Triggers for security incidents are properly set up.
- Actions to mitigate threats are accurately configured and tested.

---

### **Step 2: Implement Security Playbooks for Resource Protection**

**Objective:** Use **Azure Security Center's Security Playbooks** to respond automatically to security alerts. These playbooks can orchestrate responses across resources to contain or address security threats.

**Details:**
- **Playbook Examples:** 
  - Isolate a VM if an intrusion is detected.
  - Reset access keys on Key Vault after multiple failed access attempts.

> **Mission Directive:** Create a Security Playbook in Azure Security Center that responds to high-severity security alerts.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Task: Design Security Playbooks for Critical Scenarios**

Use Azure Security Center to create automated responses. The solution is detailed below if needed.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Solution for Step 2</summary>

  1. **In Azure Security Center**, navigate to Playbooks.
  2. **Create a new playbook** triggered by high-severity alerts.
  3. **Add response actions**: For instance, isolate affected VMs, reset Key Vault credentials, and log each action for auditing.

</details>

---

### **Step 3: Implement Data Integrity and Automatic Service Recovery**

**Objective:** Configure automated responses to detect data integrity issues or service disruptions and initiate recovery processes. This step ensures that if data is modified unexpectedly or a critical service goes down, the system can restore operations or alert the appropriate teams.

**Details:**
- **Simulation Tasks:** Set up triggers for conditions such as unexpected database changes or a service going offline.
- **Automated Actions:** Implement Logic Apps or Azure Functions to revert unauthorized changes or restart services automatically.

> **Mission Directive:** Create a workflow that monitors for data integrity issues or service unavailability and triggers automatic recovery actions.

---

### **üõ†Ô∏è Task: Configure Automatic Detection and Recovery**

In this task, set up monitoring rules and recovery actions for data consistency and service continuity. Use the solution below if needed.

<details>
  <summary>üöÄ Solution for Step 3</summary>

  1. **Set up Azure Monitor** to watch for database changes or service availability.
  2. **Create an Azure Logic App** that triggers when data anomalies or disruptions are detected.
  3. **Design recovery actions**: Automatically revert data if modified unexpectedly or restart the affected service, and send an alert to the security team.

</details>

---

### **Validation Checkpoint**

Ensure that:
- Monitoring rules are set up for data integrity and service availability.
- Recovery actions are correctly configured and triggered during testing.

---

### **Mission Completion Criteria**

- **Logic Apps workflows** are configured for automatic threat response.
- **Security Playbooks** in Azure Security Center function as intended.
- Responses are triggered correctly and recorded for audit purposes.

---

**Mission Debrief:** Automated security responses enhance resilience and operational security by reducing reliance on manual monitoring and intervention.
