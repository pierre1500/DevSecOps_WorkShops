### **🌌 Welcome, Elite Operative!**

The year is 2055. Humanity has established its first colony on Mars, and the European Space Agency (ESA) is counting on **you** to ensure the survival and prosperity of the mission. As part of the elite **Earth Command** team, you are stationed at the core of Earth’s mission control. Your role? To secure Earth's infrastructure and maintain a seamless connection with the Martian outpost.

**The Martian colony’s fate rests in your hands.** Every system, every line of code you deploy is critical to the survival of the colonists and the success of interplanetary collaboration.

### **📝 Mission Brief**

As a key member of Earth Command, you will embark on a series of critical missions. Each operation will test your expertise in infrastructure deployment, advanced cybersecurity, and incident response, as well as your ability to handle unforeseen threats from the deep reaches of space.

The following folders contain details of each mission. Prepare yourself, commander.

> **Note**: Before starting, ensure you have Azure CLI installed. Follow the setup instructions in **[Install.md](Install.md)** to get started.
