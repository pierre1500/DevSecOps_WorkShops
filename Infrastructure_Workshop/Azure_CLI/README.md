# How to Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Deployment Templates with Azure CLI

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates provide a powerful way to define and automate the deployment of your infrastructure on Azure. These templates are written in JSON format and describe the resources needed for your solution in a declarative way. By using Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface), you can deploy these templates directly from your local machine or CI/CD pipeline, making it a highly efficient and repeatable method for managing Azure environments.

This guide will walk you through the steps of deploying ARM templates using Azure CLI, from preparing the template file to executing the deployment command, and handling any necessary parameters or customization. Whether you are provisioning virtual machines, databases, or networking components, ARM templates combined with Azure CLI offer a seamless way to manage resources with precision and scalability.
